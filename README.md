# About The Project
The Document Question Answering System is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline information retrieval from vast document collections. Built on a foundation of advanced natural language processing techniques, the system features a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit. Leveraging the LangChain framework and Google Generative AI, it ingests documents, converts them into vector embeddings, and employs the Retrieval augmentation generation(RAG) architecture for accurate question answering. Users can input queries through the intuitive interface, with the system retrieving precise answers based on the document context. With its efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, the system finds applications in research, knowledge management, education, and customer support, representing a significant advancement in information access technology.
